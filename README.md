✉️Smart Email Summarizer & Priority Sorter

A demo AI/ML project that summarizes email bodies and assigns an urgency/priority score. Purpose-built to showcase practical NLP + product thinking: explainable scoring, LLM summarization (optional), and a clean Streamlit UI.

Features

Fast, concise 1–2 sentence email summaries (uses OpenAI if available, otherwise a transformers fallback).

Interpretable priority scoring (High / Medium / Low) with human-readable reasons.

Streamlit demo UI to try the project locally.

Easy hooks to upgrade scoring to a trained model (notebook suggestions included in comments).


Why this stands out

Real-world utility: hiring managers like projects that automate repetitive but important tasks.

Explainability: each score returns reasons that are easy to discuss in interviews.

Upgrade path: replace the heuristics with TF-IDF + logistic regression or a small Transformer fine-tune and show A/B results.
